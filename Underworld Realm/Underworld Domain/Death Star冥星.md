## Death Star
-In the ancient times of Death Star, the Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe were not always the eternal inhabitants they are today. The origins of these tribes are steeped in the legends of the Underworld Domain. It is said that the first Zombies were once living beings who, through dark rituals, extended their existence beyond death. They were driven by an insatiable longing for the life they had lost, wandering the Nether Realm in search of a way to reclaim their lost humanity.
The Skeleton Tribe, on the other hand, emerged from the remains of ancient warriors and scholars who dedicated their lives to protecting the secrets of the Underworld. Through powerful necromantic magic, their spirits were bound to their skeletal remains, transforming them into eternal guardians of Death Star. These skeletons, with their hollow forms and deep eye sockets, serve as the protectors of the star field, often invading other planets under the guise of maintaining order and balance.
One of the most famous legends is that of the Ancestor's Pact. It is said that the progenitors of both the Zombie and Skeleton tribes once struck a pact with the ancient deity Hades, the ruler of the Underworld. Hades granted them eternal life in exchange for their unwavering loyalty and service. This pact is what binds the two tribes to Death Star and grants them their unique powers.
Another key legend speaks of the Lost Temple of Souls, a hidden sanctuary somewhere within the Spectral Swamp. This temple is believed to be the resting place of the first necromancer who unlocked the secrets of life and death. According to the legend, whoever finds this temple will gain the ultimate power to control the dead and alter the fate of Death Star.
- **City of Silence**: Located in the east of Death Star, the City of Silence is a sprawling necropolis shrouded in an eternal twilight. The air here is thick with the scent of decay and the echoes of lost souls. The architecture is a haunting blend of towering spires and crumbling walls, creating a labyrinthine maze that traps unwary travelers. At the heart of the city lies the Core of Silence, a mysterious epicenter where a perpetual mist spreads, obscuring the vision and senses of those who venture too close.
The Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe wander aimlessly through the city's winding streets, their presence a constant reminder of the thin veil between life and death. The zombies, driven by an insatiable hunger for life, often engage in ritualistic dances and ceremonies, believed to be attempts to resurrect their former selves. Skeletons, acting as the city's guardians, enforce the strict laws of the underworld, ensuring that the delicate balance of existence is maintained.
Legends speak of an ancient prophecy hidden within the city's oldest tombs, inscribed on the stone tablets by a long-forgotten civilization. These prophecies foretell a time when the City of Silence will awaken, leading to a great upheaval in the Underworld Domain. Scholars and necromancers from across the star system come to study these inscriptions, hoping to unlock the secrets of life, death, and rebirth.
- **Spectral Swamp**: To the west of Death Star lies the Spectral Swamp, an eerie, luminescent marshland that glows with a faint blue-white light, especially vivid under the shroud of night. The swamp is surrounded by mist-covered hills known as the Hills of Silence, where strange bioluminescent plants grow, offering the only natural light in this otherwise dark and foreboding landscape.
The swamp is said to be home to the Spring of Souls, a hidden spring believed to absorb and store the souls of the dead. The water of the Spring of Souls shimmers with a pale blue hue and is thought to possess miraculous healing powers. However, the swamp is fraught with danger; legends tell of ancient spirits and deadly creatures that guard the secrets of the spring.
Zombies and skeletons often venture into the swamp in search of the spring, driven by the hope of resurrection or the healing power it promises. The Zombie Tribe, with their unending quest for life, are particularly drawn to the swamp's mysteries. The Skeleton Tribe, acting as guardians, patrol the swamp's periphery, ensuring that only the worthy gain access to its hidden treasures.
Scholars believe that the Spectral Swamp holds the key to understanding the cycle of life and death. The luminescent plants and the unique ecosystem provide a rich area of study for biologists and necromancers alike, who seek to unravel the swamp's secrets and harness its power.
- **Plain of Despair**:In the central northern region of Death Star lies the Plain of Despair, an endless wasteland where the wind howls through the barren expanse. The landscape is dotted with ancient stone tablets inscribed with symbols of an unknown language, seemingly recording some ancient prophecy. The air is thick with a sense of desolation, and life here appears nearly nonexistent.
The Plain of Despair is a place of reflection and introspection for the inhabitants of Death Star. Zombies and skeletons often come here to contemplate their existence and the nature of the universe. The plain's eerie silence and vast emptiness provide a stark contrast to the rest of the star, making it a unique site for spiritual quests and meditations.
Legends tell of a hidden catacomb beneath the plain, where the most ancient and powerful necromancers of the past are entombed. It is said that these necromancers possess knowledge of the deepest secrets of life and death, and their spirits occasionally rise to impart wisdom to those who seek it. The catacombs are fiercely guarded by the Skeleton Tribe, who consider it their sacred duty to protect these resting places from desecration.
- **Ancient Tower of Darkness**: Northwest of the City of Silence stands the Ancient Tower of Darkness, an imposing and isolated structure surrounded by weathered ancient stone tombs. The tower's exterior is adorned with intricate carvings and runes, hinting at the forbidden knowledge contained within. Inside, the tower is a maze of layered chambers, each filled with ancient magic circles and books of forbidden lore.
The top floor of the tower houses an observatory where, on special nights, one can glimpse visions of other planets and distant realms. This observatory is a place of great fascination for necromancers and scholars, who come to the tower seeking insights into the mysteries of the cosmos.
The Ancient Tower of Darkness is also a place of pilgrimage for the inhabitants of Death Star. Zombies and skeletons come to study the ancient texts and participate in rituals that connect them with the deeper mysteries of existence. The tower's guardians, a group of elite skeletons known as the Death Wardens, ensure that the tower's secrets remain protected from those who would misuse them.
- **Nether Court**: Situated in the southeastern corner of the Plain of Despair, the Nether Court is a vast courtyard constructed from black stone. The architectural style and sculptures here exude a sense of reverence and acceptance of death. Black obelisks and statues of ghostly figures line the pathways, and in the center of the courtyard lies a dark fountain, perpetually bubbling with black water.
The Nether Court is a place of judgment and reflection. It serves as a court for the souls of the dead, where they are weighed and judged by the ancient spirits that inhabit the courtyard. The dark fountain is said to be a portal to an unknown dark realm, where souls deemed unworthy are cast away, while those found worthy are granted another turn in the cycle of life and death.
The Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe both hold ceremonies here, respecting the court's role in maintaining the balance of the Underworld Domain. The Skeleton Tribe, in particular, acts as the enforcers of the court's judgments, ensuring that the decrees are carried out without fail.
- **River of Styx**:In the southern region of Death Star flows the River of Styx, a dark and icy waterway that winds its way through the entire star. The river's banks are lined with withered trees and thorny bushes, creating a foreboding and treacherous landscape. The River of Styx is considered the only passage to the deepest parts of the Netherworld, with its banks teeming with the legendary spirits of the dead.
The ferrymen of the River of Styx are among the most mysterious figures on Death Star. These enigmatic beings ferry souls across the river, ensuring safe passage through the treacherous waters. It is said that the ferrymen possess ancient knowledge and can see into the souls of those they transport, judging their worthiness to enter the deeper realms of the underworld.
The Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe both hold the ferrymen in high regard, often seeking their guidance and protection when crossing the river. The ferrymen's role is crucial in maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of life and death on Death Star.
- **Hades Palace**:At the end of the River of Styx lies Hades Palace, the most sacred place on Death Star. This magnificent structure is built entirely from black marble and adorned with countless night jewels that shimmer with a dark, otherworldly light. The palace is the residence of the ruler of Death Star, who holds dominion over life and death across the entire planet.
The Hades Palace is a place of immense power and solemnity. The ruler, often referred to as the Death Lord, presides over the fates of all souls on Death Star. The palace's grand halls are filled with ancient relics and artifacts, each holding a piece of the star's long and storied history. The throne room, at the heart of the palace, is where the Death Lord makes decrees, guided by the counsel of the ancient spirits that reside within the palace walls.
The Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe both pay homage to the Death Lord, recognizing the authority and wisdom that emanates from Hades Palace. Ceremonies and rituals are regularly conducted here, reinforcing the cosmic balance and the cycle of life and death that governs the Underworld Domain.
- **Spring of Souls**:AHidden deep within the Spectral Swamp is the Spring of Souls, a mysterious and sacred spring believed to absorb and store the souls of the dead. The water of the Spring of Souls is a pale blue, shimmering with a faint, ethereal light that is said to possess miraculous healing powers. The spring is a place of pilgrimage for those seeking to heal or connect with the spirits of the departed.

The Zombie Tribe, in their relentless pursuit of life, often seek out the Spring of Souls in hopes of finding a way to restore their vitality. The Skeleton Tribe, acting as the protectors of the spring, ensure that only those deemed worthy can access its waters. The spring's location is kept secret, known only to the most trusted members of the Skeleton Tribe, who guard it with their lives.

Legends speak of a powerful spirit that resides within the spring, a guardian who watches over the souls stored within its waters. This spirit is said to grant boons to those who prove their worth, offering glimpses into the mysteries of life and death. Scholars and necromancers from across the star system come to study the spring, hoping to unlock its secrets and harness its power for the greater good of the Underworld Domain.

## 冥星
在冥星的古老时代，僵尸族和骷髅族并不是他们今天的永恒居民。这些族群的起源深深植根于冥域的传说中。据说，最早的僵尸曾经是活着的生物，通过黑暗的仪式，将他们的存在延续到死亡之后。他们被对失去生命的无尽渴望所驱使，在冥域中徘徊，寻找恢复失去人性的方式。
骷髅族则起源于古代战士和学者的遗骸，他们将一生奉献给保护冥域的秘密。通过强大的死灵魔法，他们的灵魂被绑定在骷髅遗骸上，变成了冥星的永恒守护者。这些骷髅，具有空洞的身形和深邃的眼窝，作为星域的守护者，常常以维护秩序和平衡的名义侵略其他星球。
最著名的传说之一是祖先之约。据说，僵尸族和骷髅族的祖先曾与冥界的统治者哈迪斯达成协议。哈迪斯赐予他们永生，以换取他们的绝对忠诚和服务。这个契约将两个族群绑定在冥星上，并赋予他们独特的力量。
另一个重要的传说讲述了灵魂失落之庙，这是一座隐藏在幽魂沼泽深处的圣殿。据传，这座庙宇是第一位解锁生与死秘密的死灵法师的安息之地。传说，找到这座庙宇的人将获得控制亡灵的终极力量，并改变冥星的命运。

幽冥圣庭是一个审判和反思的地方，作为亡灵的审判庭，亡灵的灵魂在此被古老的灵魂审判和称量。黑暗喷泉据说是通向未知黑暗领域的门户，凡被判不配的灵魂将被抛入其中，而被判配得的灵魂则被赋予另一次生死循环的机会。
僵尸族和骷髅族都在这里举行仪式，尊重圣庭在维持冥域平衡中的作用。特别是骷髅族，他们作为圣庭判决的执行者，确保判决得以无误地执行。

### 冥河
冥星南部流淌着冥河，这条黝黑而冰冷的河流贯穿整个星球。河岸两旁长满了枯树和荆棘，形成了一片阴森而危险的景观。冥河被认为是通向冥界深处的唯一通道，河岸上布满了传说中的亡灵。
冥河的摆渡人是冥星上最神秘的角色之一。这些神秘的存在将灵魂渡过河流，确保他们能够安全穿越这片危险的水域。据说摆渡人拥有古老的知识，能够看到他们所渡送灵魂的内心，判断他们是否有资格进入冥界的更深层次。
僵尸族和骷髅族都对摆渡人十分敬重，常常在渡河时寻求他们的指导和保护。摆渡人的角色在维护灵魂的流动和冥星的生死平衡中至关重要。

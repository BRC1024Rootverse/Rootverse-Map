### Sanctuary of Return
-Sanctuary of Return is the place where the essence of the three major races of the Protoss gathers in the Oracle Star Region. It is not only a temple for exploring the history of the Protoss, but also a holy place for the Protoss to recall their ancestors and reflect on the future. The heroic male Protoss, the wisdom of the female Protoss, and the brave racial characteristics of the God Warriors are integrated and intertwined here, achieving the pinnacle of Protoss civilization. On this land, the power and influence of the gods continue to be demonstrated in the long river of history, which makes people yearn for it.
- **River of Histories**: This river that runs from west to east across the entire planet is not only crystal clear, but its water also carries thousands of years of history and memory of the Protoss. There are countless monuments and sculptures along the shore, each of which is engraved with a microcosm of major historical events of the Protoss. When the bravery of the male Protoss, the wisdom of the female Protoss, and the bravery of the God Warriors interweave in the long river of history, they condense into the eternal legend of the Protoss. Walking along it, you can seem to feel the breath of those deceased heroes and the footprints left by the Protoss in the long river of time.
- **Echo Plains**: This vast plain in the southern part of the planet emits a deep and long echo when the breeze blows over it. These echoes are believed to be the calls of the Protoss heroes, echoing in this land where fierce battles once took place. There are many Protoss hero memorial halls and history museums standing on the plain for future generations to admire and learn from. Here, the heroic deeds of the male Protoss who shed their sweat to defend their homeland, the wise decisions of the female Gods who used their wisdom to resolve crises, and the thrilling scenes of the God Warriors fighting desperately on the battlefield are all recorded and engraved one by one. Visitors strolling in it seem to be able to relive those soul-stirring historical moments.
- **Ultimate Sanctuary**: This area in the northeast is regarded as the supreme holy land by the gods. Only members of the gods with special permission can enter. Here, the soul essence of the deceased members of the gods is carefully preserved. Surrounded by a solemn and sacred atmosphere, it is undoubtedly the best place for the gods to meditate and reflect. Male and female gods and god warriors will gather here to recall their deceased compatriots and reflect on the wisdom and courage of their predecessors in order to guide the future of the gods. Devout believers of the gods will also come here to make pilgrimages and pray for the protection of the gods.
- **Tranquil Forest**: This vast primeval forest is located in the west of the planet. The cypress trees in the forest have stood for thousands of years and are regarded as living witnesses of the history of the gods. The winding paths through it provide a rare quiet place for the tired gods to rest. Here, the male gods will immerse themselves in the contemplation of heroic deeds in war, the goddesses will close their eyes and meditate to explore the mysteries of the universe, and the god warriors will sing praises to the gods in the forest to seek inner strength and courage. Immersed in this silent wilderness, it seems that you can resonate with the gods and the origin of the universe.

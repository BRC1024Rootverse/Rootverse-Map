### Sanctuary of Return
Sanctuary of Return is located in the core of Oracle Realm and is known as the home of the Protoss' souls. This planet not only carries the history and memory of the Protoss, but also provides a holy place for reflection and cultivation for the Protoss members. Sanctuary of Return forms a complete system of prophecy and wisdom with the other three planets - Ares, Wheel of Destiny and Secret Origin. Ares is a symbol of power and battle, Wheel of Destiny is the controller of fate and time, Secret Origin is the guardian of secrets and origins, and Sanctuary of Return is a symbol of history and return.
- **River of Histories**: The River of Histories flows majestically from the western mountains to the eastern plains, its crystal-clear waters reflecting the heavens above. Along its banks, grand monuments and intricate sculptures tell the tales of divine history. Each monument is a masterpiece, etched with runes that glow softly at night, recounting the epic battles, divine interventions, and pivotal moments of the Male God, Goddess, and Divine Warrior races.
The river's origin is said to be a sacred spring blessed by the first God of Wisdom, whose tears of joy and sorrow formed the initial streams. These waters hold the memories of the divine race; drinking from them allows one to experience vivid visions of the past. Pilgrims often journey here to witness these visions, seeking understanding and guidance from their ancestors.
The Founding of the River of Histories: It is said that the first God of Wisdom, Orin, wept tears of joy and sorrow at the creation of the divine races. These tears formed the River of Histories, which flows through the planet, holding the memories of all divine events.
- **Echo Plains**: The Echo Plains stretch across the southern part of the planet, a vast expanse of grasslands where the wind carries the whispers of ancient heroes. When the wind blows, it creates a haunting melody that many believe to be the voices of past divine warriors. This area is dotted with memorial halls and museums, each dedicated to a different era of divine history.
The plains are also known for their unique flora, which is said to have absorbed the essence of past heroes. These plants glow faintly in the dark, creating an ethereal landscape. Divine ceremonies are often held here, where members of the divine races gather to honor their ancestors and seek their blessings for future endeavors.
The Battle of Echo Plains: During a great war between the divine races and an invading force of shadow creatures, the Echo Plains became the final battleground. The divine warriors, led by the heroic Divine Warrior Aelion, fought valiantly and defeated the invaders. Their echoes still resonate across the plains, inspiring future generations.
- **Ultimate Sanctuary**: The Ultimate Sanctuary is located in the northeast, at the heart of the Sanctuary of Return. This highly respected and protected area is only accessible to members of the divine races with special permission. It houses the essence of all departed members of the divine race, creating a sacred and tranquil atmosphere ideal for meditation and reflection.
The sanctuary is surrounded by ancient trees and serene gardens. The air here is imbued with a calming essence, and the ground is adorned with intricate patterns that glow softly. At the center stands the Temple of Echoing Souls, a grand structure where the divine races can communicate with their ancestors. The temple is a marvel of divine architecture, with walls that seem to whisper the wisdom of ages.
The Guardian of the Ultimate Sanctuary:Legend tells of a powerful Goddess named Seraphina, who was the first to guard the Ultimate Sanctuary. She ensured that only the worthy could enter, using her divine powers to test the hearts of those who sought access. Her spirit is said to still protect the sanctuary today.
- **Tranquil Forest**: The Tranquil Forest, located in the west, is a vast expanse of ancient trees that have stood for millennia. Each tree is considered a witness to history, its bark etched with the stories of the past. The forest is crisscrossed with hidden paths and resting areas, providing divine race members with a place to seek inner peace and inspiration.
The forest is also home to many mystical creatures and plants, each possessing unique properties. It is said that the forest is protected by the spirits of ancient guardians, who ensure that only those with pure intentions can find their way through. The air is filled with a serene energy, and the sounds of the forest create a symphony of nature's music, offering a perfect retreat for contemplation and renewal.
The Whispering Trees of Tranquil Forest: The ancient trees of the Tranquil Forest are believed to be imbued with the spirits of ancient male gods and goddesses. These trees whisper secrets and wisdom to those who listen closely. Many divine beings come here to seek guidance and inspiration from these whispers.

### War God Star
War God Star is one of the four major planets in the Oracle Realm, renowned for its environment brimming with combat and martial testing. This planet serves as the primary training ground and residence for the Divine Warrior Clan, but it also attracts Male Gods and Goddesses for various martial training and spiritual cultivation. War God Star is not only a forge for combat skills but also a stage where deities display their power and glory. Compared to the other three planets (Destiny Wheel Star, Veiled Origin Star, Sanctuary of Return), War God Star emphasizes practical combat and martial prowess, while the other planets focus on destiny analysis, mysterious exploration, and soul restoration, respectively.
In the ancient times of the Oracle Realm, the Male Gods, Goddesses, and Divine Warriors united to fend off dark forces from the void. In that epic battle, War God Star became the central battlefield. Legend has it that Ares, the war god of the Male Gods, and Athena, the war goddess of the Goddesses, joined forces with Leo, the leader of the Divine Warriors, to finally defeat the dark forces and protect the peace of the Oracle Realm. To commemorate this great victory, the three races decided to make War God Star an eternal training ground and a sacred site of war.
- **War God Plains**: The War God Plains are the most expansive area on War God Star, filled with various training and live combat fields. The terrain here is incredibly diverse, ranging from deep ravines to towering hills, providing a rich variety of training environments for the Divine Warriors. According to legend, the war gods of the Male Gods and Goddesses left countless battle marks here. Every rock and river has witnessed their bravery and wisdom.
  In the center of the War God Plains, there is a vast battlefield with ancient runes etched into the ground. These runes are said to be the spells used by the war gods in their battles. Whenever the moonlight shines, these runes emit a faint glow, as if telling those ancient stories. Statues of war gods stand on the surrounding hills, as if guarding this sacred land.
- **Eternal Arena**: The Eternal Arena is located at the center of War God Star, a massive open-air arena that can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. It is the venue for various significant battles and competitions, including the annual Divine Warrior Championships and the War God Ceremony. Each year, warriors from different races gather here to showcase their combat skills and strength.
The center of the arena is a vast expanse of sand, surrounded by towering stands. Whenever a competition begins, the spectators on the stands cheer and shout, filling the entire arena with an atmosphere of tension and excitement. The walls of the arena are inlaid with countless gems, which sparkle in the sunlight, as if adding a mysterious power to each battle.
- **Temple of War**: The Temple of War stands adjacent to the Eternal Arena and serves as the spiritual and command center of the Divine Warrior Clan. The interior of the temple is adorned with statues and murals of war gods from various eras, documenting the history and honors of combat. It is also the place where the Divine Warrior Clan makes major decisions and conducts sacrificial ceremonies.
The interior of the temple is spacious and sacred, with a colossal altar at the center, engraved with ancient runes and symbols of the war gods. The surrounding walls are adorned with vivid murals depicting the heroic deeds of the war gods, each painting vividly showcasing their courage and wisdom. The dome of the temple is made of pure gold, sparkling in the sunlight, as if proclaiming the glory of the Divine Warrior Clan.
- **Ironblood Village**: The Ironblood Villages are scattered around the War God Plains, primarily inhabited by Divine Warriors engaged in daily training and their families. These villages are robustly constructed to withstand potential accidental impacts during training. The villages are equipped with comprehensive training and living facilities, providing a safe and convenient living environment for the Divine Warriors.
The houses in the village are mostly built of sturdy stone and metal, presenting an ancient and resilient style. Each village has a central square equipped with various training apparatuses for the Divine Warriors to use at any time. The villages are surrounded by high protective walls, inscribed with defensive runes, capable of repelling any external threats.
- **Weapons Forge Area**: The Weapons Forge Area is located in the western part of War God Star, a specialized area dedicated to the manufacture and testing of new weapons. Here, the finest blacksmiths and weapon masters from across the universe gather to continuously provide the Divine Warriors with the most advanced combat equipment. The forge area is filled with the sound of flames and metal clashing, and the air is thick with the scent of iron and fire.
The forge area houses hundreds of furnaces, each accompanied by a massive anvil and various forging tools. Blacksmiths wield enormous hammers, shaping the red-hot metal. Fiery dragons of flame spew from the furnaces, illuminating the entire area. Whenever a new weapon is born, the blacksmiths inscribe mysterious runes onto it, bestowing it with special powers.

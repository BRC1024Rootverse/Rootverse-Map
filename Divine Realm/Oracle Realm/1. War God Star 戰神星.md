### War God Star
War God Star：The source of power for the gods in the universe
As the most militant planet in the Divine Orbit, Ares plays a key role in maintaining the power of the gods. Here, the gods receive the most rigorous combat training to hone their martial arts and defend the dignity of the gods. At the same time, it is also an important place for the gods to explore the mysteries of the universe and predict the future.
War God Star Positioning of War God Star in the Divine Orbit:
As one of the cores of the Divine Orbit, Ares is not only a holy place for the gods to practice, but also a place for the leaders of the gods to understand the mysteries of the universe. The gods hone their martial arts here and shed their blood for the interests of the gods. At the same time, the gods also explore the laws of the universe and predict the future. The three major races interweave a unique history and culture here, and together shape the sacred status of Ares.
- **War God Plains**: This is where the God Warriors usually stay. The vast plains and varied terrain provide a rich training ground. The plains are filled with simulated battlefields of various sizes, where the God Warriors PK with each other and hone their skills. You can see them sweating and fighting fiercely everywhere. The plains are surrounded by towering mountains, forming a natural barrier and providing safety for training.
- **Eternal Arena**: This majestic open-air arena is located in the center of Ares and can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. It often hosts various major combat competitions, including the annual God Warrior Championship, which attracts gods and warriors from all over the star field to watch. The arena is decorated with countless statues of the victorious God Warriors, fully demonstrating their heroic deeds. Outside the arena, many gods and spectators also gather to exchange and discuss combat skills.
- **Temple of War**: This magnificent temple is located next to the Eternal Arena and is the most sacred building on Ares. Inside the temple are countless statues of gods, depicting their heroic deeds in history. This is where the rulers of the gods formulate strategies and host celebrations, and it is also a holy place for the gods to gather and worship. Outside the temple stands a towering colonnade, exuding a sacred and solemn atmosphere, attracting an endless stream of pilgrims.
- **Ironblood Village**: These small villages scattered around the Ares Plains are where the God Warriors usually live. The village buildings are sturdy and can withstand unexpected shocks that may occur during training. Most of the villagers are engaged in weapon manufacturing, equipment maintenance and other work, providing the God Warriors with the necessary combat equipment. In the village square, you can often see the God Warriors training and competing.
- **Weapons Forge Area**: Located in the west of Ares, this area is dedicated to the manufacture and testing of new weapons. It brings together the best blacksmiths and weapon masters in the universe, who are constantly developing sharper and more powerful weapons to meet the growing combat needs of the God Warriors. The hot flames in the furnace and the sound of hammering are full of the rich smell of blacksmiths.

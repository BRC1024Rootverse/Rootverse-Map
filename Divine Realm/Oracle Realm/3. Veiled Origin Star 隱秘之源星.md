### Veiled Origin Star
Veiled Origin Star, a pivotal planet within the Oracle Realm, is shrouded in mystery and divine energy. It serves as a focal point for the divine races—Male God, Goddess, and Divine Warrior—who seek to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and harness the immense power contained within. This star is not just a place of study and ritual; it is a living testament to the divine power that shapes the universe.
- **Core Nexus**: At the heart of Veiled Origin Star lies the Core Nexus, a colossal crystalline structure emitting a pulsating light that changes color with the flow of energy. The air is filled with a resonant hum, and the ground around the Core Nexus is etched with ancient runes that glow faintly, reflecting the immense power concentrated here.
The Core Nexus is the most energy-dense area on the planet, serving as the primary source of divine power for the entire star. It is a sacred site where the divine races conduct advanced energy experiments and rituals. The Male God and Goddess races often gather here to perform complex ceremonies that maintain the balance of cosmic energies.
Legend has it that the Core Nexus was formed from the remnants of an ancient cosmic battle, where the divine races fought against a primordial darkness. The victorious deities crystallized the essence of their power into the Core Nexus, making it a beacon of light and hope.
- **Valley of Oblivion**: The Valley of Oblivion is located in the northeast, enveloped in a perpetual, impenetrable mist. The air is thick with the scent of exotic plants, and the ground is dotted with luminous minerals that glow with an inner light. Strange, twisted trees and vibrant flora thrive here, nourished by the valley's potent energies.
Protected by ancient magic, the Valley of Oblivion is a sanctuary for unknown and powerful energies. It is an ideal location for the divine races to explore the unknown and conduct experiments on exotic plants and minerals. The Divine Warrior race often ventures here to seek rare materials for forging their legendary weapons.
Ancient tales speak of a time when the Valley of Oblivion was the site of a great temple dedicated to an enigmatic deity of knowledge and secrets. The temple was said to contain scrolls and artifacts of immense power, which have since been lost to time and obscured by the valley's protective mists.
- **Divine Genesis Grounds**:Situated in the southwest, the Divine Genesis Grounds are a vast expanse marked by intricate runes etched into the very earth. The air crackles with latent energy, and the ground glows with a soft, ethereal light. Pillars of ancient stone, inscribed with celestial symbols, stand tall, creating a majestic and awe-inspiring atmosphere.
The Divine Genesis Grounds are used for the highest level of divine revelations and decisions. It symbolizes the source of the divine races' power, where fundamental cosmic forces are triggered. Here, the Male God and Goddess races convene to make decisions that shape the fate of the cosmos, guided by the ancient runes.
It is said that the Divine Genesis Grounds were created by the first deities who emerged from the primordial chaos. These deities inscribed the runes into the ground, embedding their wisdom and power into the very fabric of the planet. The Grounds are considered the most sacred site on Veiled Origin Star.
- **Stellar Observatory**: Located in the northern mountainous region, the Stellar Observatory sits atop the highest peak on Veiled Origin Star. The structure is an architectural marvel, with towering spires and intricate designs that seem to blend seamlessly with the surrounding rocky landscape. The sky above is always clear, offering an unobstructed view of the cosmos.
The Stellar Observatory is designed for observing cosmic and interstellar phenomena. It is not only technologically advanced but also capable of sensing subtle changes in the universe. This makes it a key location for understanding cosmic laws and predicting the future. The divine races, especially the Male God and Goddess, use the observatory to gain insights into the cosmic order and their place within it.
Legend tells of an ancient seer who built the first observatory on this peak, guided by visions of the stars. This seer was said to have the ability to predict major cosmic events and guide the divine races through times of turmoil. The current observatory is built upon the ruins of this ancient structure, continuing its legacy.

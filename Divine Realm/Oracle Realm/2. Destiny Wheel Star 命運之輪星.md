### Destiny Wheel Star
-Destiny Wheel Star is a mystical planet situated within the Oracle Realm, a domain revered for its deep connection to wisdom and prophecy. The planet is renowned for its central landmark, the Wheel of Destiny, and serves as a hub where divine beings from across the cosmos come to unravel the secrets of fate. The inhabitants of this planet, primarily the Male God, Goddess and Divine Warrior  races, engage in various activities centered around prophecy, divination, and the study of cosmic destiny.
- **Wheel of Destiny**: At the heart of Destiny Wheel Star lies the colossal Wheel of Destiny. This monumental structure stands as both a symbol and a functional facility, equipped with intricate mechanical and magical mechanisms designed to reveal and influence the flow of fate. The Wheel is an awe-inspiring sight, with its enormous spokes and runes glowing with an ethereal light. It is said that the Male God race constructed the Wheel, imbuing it with their formidable engineering prowess and arcane knowledg
  Legend speaks of a time when the cosmos was young, and chaos reigned supreme. It was during this epoch that the Male God race, known for their unparalleled craftsmanship and arcane prowess, undertook the monumental task of creating the Wheel of Destiny. Guided by divine visions, they constructed the Wheel to bring order to the chaotic currents of fate. The process took millennia, with each spoke and rune meticulously crafted to harness the cosmic energies.
- **Prophets' Valley**: Nestled near the Wheel of Destiny is the deep and enigmatic Prophets' Valley. This valley is home to the planet's prophets and astrologers, who reside in elaborately designed observatories and divination chambers. The valley is constantly shrouded in a mystical haze, enhancing its aura of otherworldliness. The Goddess race is particularly prominent here, using their innate connection to the cosmos to interpret the flow of destiny through stargazing and ancient rituals.
  In the annals of Destiny Wheel Star, the Prophets' Oath stands as a pivotal moment. This ancient vow, taken by the first generation of prophets in the Prophets' Valley, binds them to the eternal quest for truth and foresight. The Goddess race, with their intrinsic link to the cosmos, played a central role in the formation of this oath. It is said that the stars themselves bore witness to the solemn ceremony, and the valley has since been imbued with a perpetual aura of mysticism.
- **Divine Lake**: In the eastern part of Destiny Wheel Star lies the breathtaking Divine Lake. This crystal-clear lake is believed to possess magical properties that allow it to foresee the future. Surrounding the lake are numerous meditation pavilions, where individuals come to reflect and seek inner guidance. The Divine Warrior race often visits the lake to meditate and gain insights into their paths, believing that the lake's waters can reveal hidden truths and future events.
  The Divine Lake is the site of countless personal revelations and profound insights. One of the most notable stories is that of a young Divine Warrior who, during a period of great turmoil, sought solace by the lake. Through deep meditation, he received visions that guided him to a hidden threat within the realm. His subsequent actions, inspired by the lake's prophetic waters, averted a catastrophe and earned him a place among the most revered heroes of the planet.
- **Gates of Choice**: In the northern region of the planet, the Gates of Choice stand as a formidable trial ground. These massive stone gates represent different destiny choices, and novice prophets must pass through them to prove their foresight abilities. Each gate is adorned with intricate carvings and ancient runes, and passing through them requires not only wisdom but also courage. The Male God race is known for their rigorous training here, as they believe that mastering the Gates of Choice is crucial for their role as destiny's guardians.
  One of the most storied events in the history of Destiny Wheel Star is the Battle of the Gates of Choice. This epic confrontation saw the Divine Warrior race defending the planet from an invasion by dark entities seeking to corrupt the Gates' power. The warriors, guided by visions from the prophets, fought valiantly to protect the sanctity of the Gates. Their heroic actions not only preserved the planet's destiny but also solidified their legacy as the stalwart defenders of the realm.
- **Library of Destiny**: South of the Wheel of Destiny lies the vast and ancient Library of Destiny. This grand library stores extensive theories of cosmic fate and historical records. It serves as both a place of learning and research and a treasure trove for uncovering clues about destiny. The library is known for its towering shelves filled with scrolls and tomes, each containing invaluable knowledge. The Goddess race, with their profound understanding of the universe, plays a key role in maintaining and expanding the library's vast collection.
  The Library of Destiny was founded through the combined efforts of the Male God and Goddess races. Recognizing the need to preserve and expand their understanding of cosmic fate, they established the library as a beacon of knowledge. The Goddess race, with their deep cosmic insights, contributed vast amounts of lore and scrolls, while the Male God race designed the library's intricate architecture. Together, they created a sanctuary of wisdom that continues to enlighten scholars and prophets to this day.




## 命運之輪星
命運之輪星是位於神諭星域內的一個神秘星球，這個領域因其深厚的智慧和預言連結而受到尊崇。這顆星球以其核心地標——命運之輪——而聞名，成為來自宇宙各地的神靈解開命運秘密的中心。這顆星球的居民主要是男神族、女神族和神斗士族，他們從事各種圍繞預言、占卜和研究宇宙命運的活動。

### 命運之輪
命運之輪星的核心地標是巨大的命運之輪。這座宏偉的建築既是象徵也是實際的功能設施，內部設有複雜的機械和魔法結構，用來揭示和影響命運的流向。命運之輪的景象令人驚嘆，其巨大的輪輻和符文散發著神秘的光芒。據說，這座輪盤是由男神族建造的，並賦予了他們強大的工程技術和神秘知識。
傳說在宇宙初生、混沌肆虐的時代，男神族以其無與倫比的工藝和神秘力量，承擔了創造命運之輪的艱巨任務。在神聖的異象指引下，他們建造了這座輪盤，以將命運的混亂潮流帶入秩序。這一過程歷時千年，每一個輪輻和符文都被精心製作，以捕捉宇宙的能量。

### 預言者谷
命運之輪附近是一個深邃而神秘的預言者谷。這個山谷是星球上預言者和占星師的家園，他們居住在精心設計的天文台和占卜室中。谷中常年籠罩著神秘的霧氣，增強了它的神秘氛圍。女神族在這裡尤為著名，她們利用與宇宙的天生連結，通過觀測星象和古老的儀式來解讀命運的走向。
在命運之輪星的歷史中，預言者之誓是一個關鍵時刻。這個古老的誓言由預言者谷的第一代預言者所立，將他們與追求真理和預見的永恆使命緊密相連。女神族以其與宇宙的內在連結，在這一誓言的形成中起到了核心作用。據說，星辰見證了這個莊嚴的儀式，此後，山谷便充滿了永恆的神秘氣息。

### 神湖
命運之輪星的東部是令人驚嘆的神湖。這個晶瑩剔透的湖泊被認為具有預見未來的神奇屬性。湖邊建有許多靜思亭，供人們來此反思和尋求內心的指引。神斗士族經常來到湖邊冥想，尋求對他們道路的洞察，認為湖水能揭示隱藏的真相和未來的事件。
神湖是無數個人啟示和深刻洞察的發源地。其中最著名的故事之一是一位年輕的神斗士，在一段巨大動蕩的時期，來到湖邊尋求安慰。通過深度冥想，他接收到指引他發現星域內隱藏威脅的異象。他隨後受到湖水預示的啟發，行動起來，避免了一場災難，並因此成為星球上最受尊敬的英雄之一。

### 選擇之門
星球的北端，選擇之門是一個令人敬畏的試煉場所。這些巨大的石門代表著不同的命運選擇，新晉預言者必須通過這些門來證明自己的預見能力。每扇門都裝飾著精緻的雕刻和古老的符文，通過它們需要不僅僅是智慧，還需要勇氣。男神族以在此進行嚴格的訓練而聞名，因為他們相信掌握選擇之門對於他們作為命運守護者的角色至關重要。
命運之輪星歷史上最富傳奇色彩的事件之一是選擇之門之戰。這場史詩般的對抗中，神斗士族捍衛了這顆星球，抵禦了試圖腐化選擇之門力量的黑暗勢力的入侵。這些戰士在預言者的異象指引下，英勇作戰，保護了選擇之門的神聖。他們的英雄行動不僅保護了星球的命運，也鞏固了他們作為星域堅定捍衛者的傳統。

命運圖書館的創建是男神族和女神族共同努力的結果。意識到保存和擴展對宇宙命運理解的必要性，他們成立了這座圖書館，作為知識的燈塔。女神族以其深刻的宇宙洞察，貢獻了大量的傳說和卷軸，而男神族則設計了圖書館複雜的建築結構。他們共同創造了一個智慧的聖地，至今仍在啟發學者和預言者。

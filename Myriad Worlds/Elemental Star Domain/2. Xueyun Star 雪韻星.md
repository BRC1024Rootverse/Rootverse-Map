Inside the tower, there are ice sculptures of Buddha, ancient scriptures, and frosty magical treasures, representing the mysterious fusion of ice and snow. It is a place of quiet reflection and intense study, where the Frostborn seek spiritual enlightenment and mastery over their elemental powers.
- **Frost Forest**:Situated in the northwest of the planet, this is a vast evergreen forest. Despite the perennial snowfall, the creatures here have special abilities to adapt to the cold, representing life's adaptability and resilience. The Frostborn often venture into the Frost Forest to gather rare herbs and to bond with the unique wildlife that thrives in this frozen environment.
- **Cold Wind Valley**:Located in the southern part of the planet, this area consists of canyons. Due to the wind tunnels formed by the canyons, it is perpetually windy here. The Frostborn have built windmills and other structures to harness the power of the wind, using it to generate energy and to power their intricate ice-crafted machinery.
- **Frozen Soul Lake**: Found north of Eternal Frost City, the lake's surface is frozen year-round, only breaking open on specific days to reveal the water beneath. It is said that deep within the lake exists a magical plant known as the "Ice Soul Flower," which absorbs moonlight and emits a faint blue light at night, adding a touch of mystery to the frozen lake surface. The Frostborn hold annual festivals at Frozen Soul Lake to honor this mystical plant, believing it to be a gift from their ancestral spirits.

## Martial Arts Star
- **Martial Arts Domains**: There are various martial arts sites distributed on the planet, ranging from volcanoes with flowing magma to seas with high winds and waves, providing martial artists with various exercise environments. These places aim to challenge the limits of warriors, testing their endurance, strength, and skills.

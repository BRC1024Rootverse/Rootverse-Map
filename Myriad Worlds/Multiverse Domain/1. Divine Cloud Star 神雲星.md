## Divine Cloud Star
- **Nebula Sea**: Located in the western part of Divine Cloud Star, the Sea of Nebula is an expansive cloud ocean surrounded by magnificent cloud pillars. At its center stands the Cloud Chamber, a grand structure suspended in the clouds, made from shimmering white stone and star dust. Inside, the chamber is adorned with murals depicting the history of the Divine race and sculptures symbolizing wisdom, each piece telling the glorious history of the Divine race.
Legend has it that the Sea of Nebula was the first meeting place between the Divine race and the Loong race. The leaders of both races held their first peace talks in the Cloud Chamber, establishing a long-lasting friendly relationship. The success of this meeting also made Divine Cloud Star a preferred location for other races to conduct diplomatic activities.
- **Interstellar Temple**: The Interstellar Temple, located in the eastern part of Divine Cloud Star, is an ancient and mysterious structure perched on a floating boulder. It is said that the temple serves as a bridge for soul communication between the Divine race and other races. Here, the prophets of the Divine race conduct ancient rituals to engage in spiritual communication with the sages of the StarTraveler race, exchanging information and wisdom.
The establishment of this temple is also linked to a leader from ancient times—the first high priest of the Divine race, Anur. Legend has it that during a meditation session, Anur communicated with the soul of a StarTraveler and received significant revelations about the mysteries of the universe. These revelations helped the Divine race find more allies in the cosmos and strengthened their ties with other races.
- **Divine Sound Gardens**: Located at the southern end of Divine Cloud Star, the Divine Sound Garden is an expansive garden filled with exotic plants from across the universe. At the center of the garden is a naturally formed musical fountain, where the water flows against the rocks, creating melodious sounds. It is a sacred place for the Divine race to relax and meditate.
Legend has it that this garden was designed by a Divine horticulturist named Evelyn, who collected plants from all over the universe and planted them here. Evelyn also discovered the musical fountain and used its music to heal countless Divine souls. Eventually, this place became an important site for the Divine race to recuperate and meditate.
- **Star Observation Deck**:Situated at the highest point of Divine Cloud Star, the Stellar Observatory is equipped with the most advanced astronomical equipment for observing and studying celestial bodies and phenomena in the universe. The observatory is not only a place for scientific research but also for educating the new generation of the Divine race about the mysteries of the cosmos.
Legend has it that an ancient leader of the Divine race, the astronomer Kael, discovered an impending supernova explosion during an observation session and successfully predicted its timing. This discovery not only elevated the Divine race's status in the universe but also earned the respect of other races for their scientific prowess.
- **Divine Realm Bridge**: The Divine Bridge is a floating bridge connecting the Celestial Temple and the Cloud Chamber, with a pathway woven from stardust and clouds, making walking on it feel like stepping into the sky. This bridge symbolizes the unity of the Divine race and their aspiration to reach greater heights.
Legend has it that the Divine Bridge was constructed by a Divine architect named Ellis, who used his power to solidify stardust and clouds into a tangible form, creating this miraculous bridge. Ellis received assistance from the Forestians and Techies during the construction, which also fostered collaboration and exchange between Divine Cloud Star and other races.
- **Zenith Temple**: The Celestial Temple, located on a massive floating cloud, is perpetually shrouded in a mystical mist. It is the spiritual center of the Divine race, attracting thousands of pilgrims every year. The interior of the temple is lavishly decorated, resplendent with gold and enshrining numerous statues of Divine deities.
Legend has it that the Celestial Temple was built by the ancestors of the Divine race, with each stone meticulously carved. It is said that at the highest point of the temple, there is a sacred stone that allows direct communication with deities in the universe. The leaders of the Divine race conduct important sacrificial ceremonies here to seek the deities' blessings and guidance.
